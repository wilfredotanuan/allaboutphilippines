                    <p> The Philippines is composed of 7,107 separate islands (7,106 during high tide), only 880 of which are inhabited. The three major geographical areas in the Philippines are the large island of Luzon in the north, which includes Manila; the large island of Mindanao in the south; and the group of islands lying between them, known as the Visayas. The three stars on the Philippine flag symbolize these three areas.</p>
                    <p> The island geography of the Philippines includes about 21,000 miles of natural coastline. Much of the coastal area is rugged and irregular, punctuated by numerous natural harbors and picturesque coves. The Philippines also has some of the most spectacular beaches to be found in the South Pacific. Sites that would live up to anyone's fantasy of a pristine South Pacific paradise of white sand beaches and crystal blue waters, they are a popular destination for tourists from around the world. Unfortunately, the heavy pollution and rocky coastline of Manila Bay render the metro Manila area itself unsuited for leisurely Sundays at the beach. </p>
                    <p> The interior of the country is generally mountainous, with several mountain peaks reaching almost 10,000 feet. In addition, the Philippines has extensive fertile plains along the coast and in the center of the country. It also features lush and scenic rolling hills, with rich valleys crossed by rivers. There are numerous volcanoes in the country, and some are frequently active. The most recent and infamous example was the eruption of Mt. Pinatubo on June 12, 1991, which was the largest volcanic eruption of the century. The Mt. Pinatubo eruption permanently altered the topography of northern Luzon and continues to cause flood control problems. </p>

                    <p> The Philippines has a tropical climate, but it is marginally less hot and humid than many tropical countries for most of the year. Although the sun shines almost year round, there are slight seasonal variations in the weather. The dry summer season, which runs from about late April to early June is hot and humid and with little rainfall. The typhoon season runs from June to September, with frequent drenching rains that can temper the heat somewhat but also preclude any outdoor activities. The downpours are often limited in duration, but the resulting flash floods can create chaos by blocking streets, stranding motorists, and bringing the already congested traffic of Manila to a virtual standstill. The most pleasant season follows the rainy season, from November until March. During this time of year, mornings can be fresh, and even the midday temperatures remain bearable, with frequent breezes that temper the heat.</p>
                    <p> The temperature range in Manila is relatively narrow, with minimum temperatures in the mid-70s and highs in the mid-90s, and an annual mean of about 80Â°F. Average relative humidity ranges from 69% in April to 84% in August or September.</p>
                    <p> Baguio, the original summer capital of the Philippines, is located 155 miles north of Manila at an altitude of about 5,000 feet. The climate varies between the dry and the very wet season, each lasting about six months. The dry season runs from December to May, with temperatures ranging from the 50s and 60s at night to highs in the mid-80s during the day. Baguio averages 176 inches of rainfall a year, about half of which falls in July and August alone. The rains begin tapering off in September and are light in October and November.</p>
